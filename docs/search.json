In particular, I‚Äôm interested in building gauge equivariant neural network architectures and using inductive priors to incorporate physical symmetries into machine learning models.\nI received my PhD in Physics from the University of Iowa in 2019 and my thesis was on Learning Better Physics: A Machine Learning Approach to Lattice Gauge Theory. Prior to this, I completed two bachelors degrees (Engineering Physics and Applied Mathematics, 2015) from The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My undergraduate dissertation was titled Energy Storage in Quantum Resonators and was supervised by Professor Alfred H√ºbler within the Center for Complex Systems Research at UIUC."
